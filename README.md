Welcome to the documentation of our TinyAIoT project. This project was developed as part of a project seminar in the Information Systems and Geoinformatics Master's programs at the University of Münster together with the cities of Emsdetten and Laer.

The project is concerned with the development of sensors to advance cities in the smart city sector. On the one hand, a sensor was developed that measures the fill level of public garbage cans, and on the other, a sensor that records and analyzes the volume in an area. This data is collected and displayed in a dashboard, which the cities can then use to send optimized routes for emptying the garbage cans to their specialists, or to track the development of noise levels and, if necessary, develop measures to take action against violations.

## Project Management
This section describes various aspects related to project management. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the entire project and assist those who wish to integrate the project into their own systems. By understanding our structure and methodologies, readers can adopt successful processes and avoid the pitfalls we encountered.





### Objectives and Requirements

At the start of the project, there was already the idea of equipping waste garbage cans with fill level sensors in order to show these fill levels on a dashboard and thus give cities the opportunity to create dedicated routes for full waste garbage cans so that not all waste garbage cans always have to be collected. The supervisors presented an illustration for this, which served as a leitmotif until the end of the project:

 Initial discussions with the cities revealed that, in addition to smart trashcans, there was also great interest in a sensor system that measures the noise level at certain times of the day in order to better identify problems such as disturbance of the peace. As a result, in addition to our main project of smart trashcans, we also defined a side project for noise detection, so we differentiated between these projects.

### Identified Problems
Both internally and in the various meetings with the cities, we identified the core problems that set the framework for the overall project:


| Smart Trashcans | Noise Detection |
|:---:|:---:|
|Most Trashcans are not attached to a sensor|Citizens like to use public spaces at night|
|Waste management employees have their fixed routes|Residents at public spaces want to rest|
|Cities do not have an overview on fill levels|Cities have limited law enforcement personnel|
|--> Waste retreival processes are inefficient|--> Citizens and residents are in conflict|

### Project Objectives
To address the challenges identified in the initial phase of the project, we established the following objectives:

| Smart Trashcans | Noise Detection |
|:---:|:---:|
| Create a TinyAIoT prototype for trashcans to measure their fill level| Create a TinyAIoT prototype for noise detection to measure decibel and the likeliness of noise|
| Create a dashboard based on the cities' requirements to display trashcan fill level and offer routing options| Create a machine learning model to identify the source of noise|
| Configure and deploy trashcan sensors and display them in the dashboard| Create a dashboard tab to display noise measurements|

According to the objectives of our project, we divided our team into different groups for the further course of the project.
